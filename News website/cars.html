            <h1>The Ares S1 Is The Lovechild Of A 918 Spyder And The Batmobile</h1>
            <img src="./media/porsche918.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                You might remember Ares for its Lamborghini Huracan-based, De Tomaso Pantera-imitating Panther, 
                or perhaps the Ferrari 412-echoing ‘Project Pony’, which is a GTC4Lusso underneath. 
                The latest creation to emerge from the Modena-based company, however, isn’t based on 
                anything, nor is its styling referencing an existing vehicle - the ‘S1’ is billed as Ares’ 
                “first-ever wholly-designed supercar”.
                It certainly looks attention-grabbing, with shades of the Porsche 918 Spyder and the Bugatti 
                Chiron at the rear, a heavily sloping rear that accentuates the huge rear haunches, 
                and giant rear wheels. Overall, there’s quite a Batmobile vibe to the thing.

    <h1>The Ferrari Portofino M Is Faster, Sharper And More Expensive</h1>
            <img src="./media/ferrari.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Just three years into its life, the Ferrari Portofino. It provided a sizeable leap from 
                the so-so California T it replaced, but it seems Maranello thought there was room for improvement. 
                The Italian firm has decided to tweak almost every aspect of the outgoing car to create this 
                replacement: the Portofino M.
                The M stands for ‘Modificata’, which is a nice change from the usual ‘S’ badge many 
                manufacturers favour for cars like this. First up, we need to take a look under the bonnet. 
                Here, you’ll still find a 3.9-litre twin-turbo V8, but this time it makes 612bhp, up from 592bhp.

            <h1>The New BMW M135i Has Already Shed £10,000 On The Used Market</h1>
            <img src="./media/bmw.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                This week we learned that BMW has a new front-wheel drive hot hatch in the form of 
                the 128ti. It’s lighter and - from the sounds of early driving impressions - more interesting 
                to drive than the M135i. The best part, however, is it’s likely to be significantly cheaper 
                than the range-topping 1er, which has a starting price of £37,470.
                Nudging £40,000 even before options are taken into account, the M135i is a hard sell. 
                But if your hot 1-series simply has to have all-wheel drive, the good news is you don’t 
                need to pay as much as that.

            <h1>Why Wouldn't You Want To Watch A Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport Catching Air?</h1>
            <img src="./media/bugatti.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Think Bugatti, and top speed will likely come to mind first. Modern era Bugs have been all
                about achieving ludicrous top speeds, with the Chiron Super Sport 300+ and its 304mph record 
                bringing about the culmination of this quest for v-max glory.
                We don’t tend to associate these cars with hot laps on challenging circuits, but the Pur Sport 
                isn’t your average Chiron. Limited to 60 units, it’s a hypercar that “yearns for corners,” Bugatti claims.
                It’s had a 50kg weight drop, 65 per cent stiffer front springs added at the front and 33 per 
                cent firmer ones at the rear, new carbon fibre anti-roll bars, and bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 Rs.
                Even with that in mind, though, it does seem odd watching one of these circa-two-tonne
                hulks throwing shapes on track - like a heavyweight boxer nailing a perfect pirouette 
                at a West End rendition of Swan Lake.
