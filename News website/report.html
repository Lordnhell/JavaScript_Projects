        <h1>Report: LH News Responsive website By Devansh Gupta</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 30px;">
                Introduction: the LH news website is meant for all sorts of news categories. The overall idea is to make it as concise
                and to the point as possible. This website has elements that clearly segregate all the different news types into 
                a dedicated space so that users can navigate more easily on a single page rather having to navigate through 
                different pages to get to the article that they want to view. I experienced this while researching for this coursework
                assignment and decided to come up this layout. The blog cards are meant to update everyday with each new article 
                and with the login feature, prioritize the preferred news categories of the user. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have implemented an animated side bar with a search menu in it as my javascript implementations. In these,
                the idea was to provide convenience to the user. If it is an old article or an article that is not in the preferred searches
                , they can search for it in the sidebar search menu. Otherwise it is hidden from view with a small button at the top.
                There is also a navigation bar at the top of the index page for ease of navigation when a user enters the site, however 
                the bar is removed in the article pages because the emphasis of the site is on the content of the article therefore
                the side bar is used instead so that it takes up as little space as possible. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I was inspired by the concise and efficient design of most news channels. Examples of these sites are : https://www.straitstimes.com/, https://www.washingtonpost.com/ 
                and more. I was primarily inspired by the card framework used in these websites which provided more emphasis on 
                the title and the image of the news in the card. It got rid of any details of the individual post. If a reader wants to find out
                more about the topic, he/she is navigated to a sperate page, automatically scrolled to the specific blog post. I also drew
                inspiration from websites meant for more designer products like https://shop.mango.com/sg or https://www.apple.com/. 
                These websites put a lot emphasis on making their websites more appealing to the user so that the time spent on the website is
                higher. Most of the
                news websites I viewed were not particularly riddled with design, but the rather bland and had a lot of monochrome colours.  
                <br>
                <br>
                The website is responsive and can adapt to most screen sizes of modern computer screens, phones, and tablets.
                The elements of the page resize and change positions according to the screen it is being accessed on. For mobiles, 
                the blog posts become in a single column and resizes the navigation bar, header and footers. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I implemented usability features for blind people by adding alternate text to all of the images in the website. 
                And as this is a text rich website, the narrator of the website will be very clear and easy to understand. The search 
                menu is also tailored for very specific searches that include important keywords of any article in the site. The removal of
                the navigation bar from the other article pages also contributes to this as the narrator will not repeat what it has 
                already said while first entering the site. The website is also free to be used by all ages as there is no mature
                content and provides an educational purpose to it as well.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Most of the features implemented required a lot of tinkering in order to properly set it in as I was unfamiliar 
                with the values and controls of the html and css. The media queries for making the website responsive were perhaps
                the most challenging segment of this build. A lot of sources like videos, articles and other websites had to be referred
                to in order to implement it correctly. A new tool I used that was not used in our course was the Visual studio code software
                by Microsoft. I found it to be very suitable to my needs and way of building. The shortcuts and the extensions which
                are made by free users using the software were very helpful in producing the product.
                <br>
                <br>
                The aspects that really worked well are the side bar, search bar menu and the blog posts. I am very satisfied with its design and functionality. 
                The animations are smooth, the searches work well and the search results navigate me to the specific blog post. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, despite my efforts to learn the media queries, the responsiveness of the website on some screen sizes
                does not work as well as it should. When resizing the website with the browser tools, the elements get distorted and look squished.
                In the future, I will pay more emphasis on the responsiveness of the website.
                <br>
