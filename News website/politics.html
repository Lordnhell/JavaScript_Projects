        <h1>“I Don’t Think Science Knows”: Trump Denies Climate Crisis In Visit To Fire-Ravaged California</h1>
        <img src="./media/trump 2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
        President Trump blatantly denied the climate crisis’ role in the unprecedented wildfires ravaging the west coast during a Monday visit with top officials in California. Meanwhile,
        Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden eviscerated Trump the same day in an address, calling out the 
        incumbent president’s repeated climate crisis denial. During a roundtable meeting that included California Gov. 
        Gavin Newsom (D), state officials pleaded with Trump that the climate crisis is responsible for the recent surge of 
        devastating wildfires. The blazes have burned more than 4.6 million acres across 10 states—including California, 
        Oregon, and Washington—since mid-August, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. California 
        Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot rebutted Trump’s claims that forest mismanagement is responsible for 
        the fires, telling the president that the climate crisis is making each season warmer and drier, contributing to the deadly fires. Trump responded, “It’ll start getting cooler… You just watch.”

        <h1>Trump gives blessing to deal to allow TikTok to continue to operate in US</h1>
        <img src="./media/tiktok.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            WASHINGTON/NEW YORK: US President Donald Trump said he supports a deal that will allow TikTok to continue to 
            operate in the United States, after threatening to ban the Chinese-owned app in August.
            He told reporters at the White House he backs the deal with TikTok owner ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart to create a 
            new company that will assume TikTok's US operations called TikTok Global.
            Trump said the new company will be "totally controlled by Oracle and Walmart ... All of the control is Oracle and 
            Walmart".
            US shareholders are expected to control 53 per cent of TikTok Global, a person briefed on the matter said, while Chinese investors
            will hold 36 per cent.
            Oracle said it will take a 12.5 per cent stake in TikTok Global.
            TikTok said under the deal, Oracle and Walmart will take part in a TikTok Global pre-IPO financing round in which they
            can take up to a 20 per cent cumulative stake in the company.

        <h1>Kim Jong Un could reveal terrifying ballistic missile at military parade</h1>
        <img src="./media/kimjong.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            Kim Jong Un may debut a terrifying new rocket that could wipe out US cities at a massive military parade in 
            North Korea, according to a report.
            Satellite photos showed the country has been rehearsing for the Oct. 10 military parade in temporary structures 
            large enough to conceal the Hwasong-15, a nuclear missile with the potential to attack New York or Washington,
            DC, the Sunday Times reported.
            Watchers of the Hermit Kingdom have said they believe Kim will use the 75th-anniversary celebration of the 
            Workers’ Party of Korea to show off the country’s arsenal and possibly the Hwasong-15, the outlet reported.
            The missile has been described in state media as a “new type of inter-continental ballistic rocket weaponry
            system capable of carrying super-heavy nuclear warhead and attacking the whole mainland of the US.”
            Other satellite images revealed work being done on the Okryu Bridge in Pyongyang, which links the rehearsal
            grounds with the expected route of the parade, the outlet reported.
            This could indicate that workers are preparing the bridge to handle a hefty load, such as the missiles and their 
            heavy transporters, according to the report.
