        <h1>Football: Napoli seize on Parma's mistakes as spectators return to Serie A after six months</h1>
        <img src="./media/football.jpg"alt="">
        <p>
            PARMA (REUTERS) - Napoli pounced on two defensive mistakes to win 2-0 at Parma in their opening match of 
            the Italian football season on Sunday (Sept 20), as spectators returned to Serie A for the first time since March.
            Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne got Napoli's campaign off to a winning start with second-half goals shortly after 
            club-record signing Victor Osimhen was brought on for his debut.
            A smattering of fans, wearing masks and widely spaced apart, watched the game at the Stadio Tardini after the 
            Italian government agreed to allow up to 1,000 spectators at matches for the first time since the Covid-19 lockdown.

        <h1>Tennis: Halep to meet Pliskova in Italian Open title clash</h1>
        <img src="./media/tennis.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            ROME (REUTERS) - Top seed Simona Halep overcame Spaniard Garbine Muguruza 6-3 4-6 6-4 on Sunday (Sept 20) to
            reach the Italian Open final and stay on course for her third straight WTA title.
            Halep, who skipped the US Open amid the Covid-19 pandemic, won the Dubai title before the Tour was suspended 
            and lifted the Prague crown on its resumption.
            The Romanian, who is looking to extend her winning run to 14 matches and seal a first title in Rome, will next face
            Karolina Pliskova after the Czech beat compatriot Marketa Vondrousova 6-2 6-4 in the second semi-final.

        <h1>Formula One: Asians can also compete at the very top, says Red Bull's Thai racer Alex Albon</h1>
        <img src="./media/f1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            SINGAPORE - Seeing the Thai flag on the podium was a moment to savour for
            Red Bull's Alexander Albon, who became the first Thai driver to stand on the
            podium when he finished third at the Tuscan Grand Prix last Sunday (Sept 13).
            The British-born Thai said it was very special to see the country's flag on the 
            podium and added: "I'm proud to wave the flag for everyone in Thailand that 
            has been supporting me throughout my career."
            The 24-year-old also hopes last weekend's historic achievement can inspire 
            his compatriots and those in Asia to pursue a career in Formula One.
            He said: "It's weird to think about, but I would love Thai people to see that they
            can compete at the very top. And that's not just as drivers, it's also mechanics, engineers, trainers.
            "There are so many jobs you can do in F1 and it would be amazing to see more 
            and more Thai and Asian people interested and taking part in motorsport. 
            I hope results like on Sunday can provide that inspiration."
            Albon had come close to finishing in the top three on two previous occasions – 
            at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix and this year's season-opening Austrian Grand Prix – 
            but two collisions with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton shattered those dreams.

        <h1>IPL 2020: Rajasthan Royals' Jos Buttler to miss opener due to extended quarantine after travelling with family</h1>
        <img src="./media/ipl.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            Dubai: England wicket-keeper batsman Jos Buttler will miss Rajasthan Royals' opening IPL game against 
            Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday as he is in the middle of his mandatory quarantine period, having arrived with his family.
            "I'm unfortunately going to miss the first match for Rajasthan because I'm going to be doing my quarantine
            period because I'm here with my family — which is great that the Royals have allowed me to have my 
            family out here," he said in an Instagram live from the official Royals' handle.
            "It'll be a huge help in lockdown having my family here with me."
            21 England and Australia players arrived here early this week after battling it out in the limited-
            overs series in the UK which concluded on 16 September.
            The BCCI had reduced their quarantine period to 36 hours instead of the six days that other players 
            underwent as they entered one bio-bubble from another, having arrived on a chartered flight.
            However, Buttler came on a different flight with his family and that is why he has to stay in quarantine for six days.
            Buttler is an important player for Royals. Compatriots Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes are also part of the team.
            Star all-rounder Stokes' participation in the tournament is also in doubt as he is spending his time 
            with his ailing father in New Zealand. He is expected to miss a few games at least in the first half of the tournament.
