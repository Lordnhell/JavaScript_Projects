            <h1>Facebook tells Irish court that probe threatens its EU operations: newspaper</h1>
            <img src="./media/facebook.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                DUBLIN (REUTERS) - Facebook has told Ireland's High Court it cannot see how
                its services could operate in the European Union if regulators freeze its data
                transfer mechanism, the Sunday Business Post reported, citing court documents seen by the paper.
                The US social media giant last week said that the Irish Data Protection Commission,
                its lead EU regulator, had made a preliminary decision that the mechanism
                it uses to transfer data from the EU to the United States "cannot in practice be used".
                Facebook requested and secured a temporary freeze on the order and a court 
                review in the Irish High Court, which is due to consider the issue in November.
                In an affidavit submitted to the court to request that the order be frozen, Yvonne 
                Cunnane, Facebook Ireland's head of data protection and associate general counsel,
                said it was not clear how the company could continue providing services in the EU 
                if the Irish order is enforced, the Sunday Business Post reported.
                "It is not clear to (Facebook) how, in those circumstances, it could continue 
                to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU," the newspaper 
                quoted the affidavit as saying.
                The affidavit has not been made public, a High Court spokesman said, and a 
                Facebook spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

            <h1>Apple Boosts IPad Air Performance By 40%…And Other Small Business Tech News</h1>
            <img src="./media/apple.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                According to an announcement from Apple this past week, their iPad Air tablets 
                are going to be getting a big boost in performance thanks to an innovative A14 Bionic chip.
                When compared to the models released last year, these newest tablets operate 40% 
                quicker during simple tasks, while the speed of processing graphics tasks are improved 
                by 30%. Apple's A-series processors — which the tech giant develops itself — were typically
                used for iPads and iPhones, not computers. This will be the first year that personal 
                computers will be driven by the chips, which will perform at a higher caliber and allow for greater battery life than tablets or phones. (Source: CNET)
                As you’re considering tech purchases this year, just remember that speed equals productivity.

            <h1>Millions of US users to be hit by WeChat block</h1>
            <img src="./media/wechat.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                WASHINGTON: Washington's crackdown on WeChat will disrupt communications between millions of people
                in the United States and their friends, families and business partners in China.
                But the app had not managed to reproduce in the US its success in China as the dominant smartphone-based payments platform.
                The US Commerce Department announced partial bans on Friday (Sep 18) on WeChat as well as video app TikTok.
                The order will slow down WeChat to make it unuseable in the United States for videochats with family and friends.
                "They are slowing the speed to technically make it virtually impossible to use audio, video, or send images,"
                said Wu Ziyi, a Chinese graduate student in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                In China, WeChat took the country toward cashless commerce in just a few years, and it is used by hundreds of millions for everyday payments.
                It is a kind of universal app, a digital bank account and identification card, for ordering food or a car, sending gifts,
                managing medical issues, and interfacing government services.

            <h1>EBay activates plan to shift more business to UPS and away from Postal Service because of mail delays</h1>
            <img src="./media/ebay.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                The online auction and sales site eBay, one of the U.S. Postal Service’s biggest customers, 
                said it is shifting some of its business to private-sector rival United Parcel Service because 
                of reliability issues with the agency.
                “Customers want and expect to receive their packages in the fastest and most reliable way possible, 
                which is why our collaboration with UPS comes at such a critical moment,” eBay vice president
                Marni Levine, who had previously expressed concerns about the Postal Service’s decreasing
                on-time delivery rate, wrote in a message to eBay sellers announcing the deal with UPS.
                The company 
                said that by the end of September, eBay sellers will be able to print out discounted UPS shipping labels,
                at a cost up to 62 percent cheaper than typical UPS rates.
                For the Postal
                Service, the loss of eBay revenue could be substantial: A spreadsheet of the Postal Service’s largest
                customers prepared last spring showed the e-commerce site was agency’s second-largest retail customer, 
                shipping more than 130 million items up to that point in the fiscal year. The USPS generated more than 
                $743 million in revenue from eBay packages in that fiscal year while grappling with a $160.9 billion deficit.
